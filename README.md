# Price trend prediction using world food prices

The dataset used for this project contains Food Prices data for all countries. The data comes from the World Food Programme (WFP) and covers foods such as maize, rice, beans, fish, and sugar for 76 countries and some 1,500 markets. It is updated weekly but contains to a large extent monthly data. The data goes back as far as 1992 for a few countries, although many countries started reporting from 2003 or thereafter.
Using this dataset, we will be predicting the price trend for different countries for the upcoming year as well as make suggestions for the United Nationâ€™s World Food Programme Sustainable Development Goals using the mapping tools to study how market size has changed over time, visualize the price trend for each year based on the market location, etc. 

Due to larger size, you can download the data from here: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-the-world. After downloading the data save the file as project.csv.
